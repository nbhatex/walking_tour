    "description": "Our walking tour starts just outside the Panjim bus stand. <p>Welcome to the city of Panajim. Panjim or \"the land that never floods\" was originally a small fishing village abounding in coconut groves, creeks and fields. Originally a ward of Taleigao village it so enamored Adil Shah that he built his summer palace on the bank of the Mandovi river, which later became the Government Secretariat.</p> <p>Panjim or 'New Goa' gained importance in the 1820s, after it replaced Old Goa as the administrative seat for the Portuguese government. It's architectural styles, with its Latin influences, like the overhanging verandahs, courtyards, sheltered porches, balconies and high roofs make it a unique city. Structures are often painted in indigo, ochre and terracotta and white is usually reserved for churches and chapels.</p> <p>Panjim is flanked by the river Mandovi on the North, and the hillock of Altinho on the south. It includes old quarters like Fontainhas as well as the modern Patto Plaza it's corporate district. It is one of the best-planned cities in the country thanks to the noted engineer Luis A de Maravilhas, among others. A neat grid of broad avenues and connecting roads, footpaths with provisions for tree planting, a good sewage system, gardens and sedate architecture with Latin influences, earn it the sobriquet of 'Princess of the Mandovi'</p> <p>More than 170 years old, Panjim has evolved from a sandy, swampy coconut grove into an individualistic modern city yet, retaining its quaint old-world charm.</p>",

The Viceroy of Goa, unhappy with the quality of coins minted in Old Goa ordered the mint to be shifted to New Goa. It stands in the Post Office Square, between the Post Office and the Mandovi river. Coins were minted here for seven years between 1834-1841 after which it was moved to the arsenal in Panjim. In 1870, coins were requisitioned from the Bombay Mint and in 1878, all existing coinage became obsolete.</p> <p>In 1963, Casa Da Moeda was sold to Antonia Inacio Da Silva. It was then rented to the British Telegraph briefly before it was sold to the Dias family in 1904, which are the present owners. It was one of the few buildings in India that was occupied by both the British and Portuguese.</p><p>The tiled roof, attic windows, wooden verandah and yellow arches evoke a bygone era. The building is raised off the ground and supported by masonry arches, which were built in the 1800s. It's high ceiling, Dutch doors, wooden floors and fragile window panes make it a marvel of architecture and antiquity.</p><p>A festival of art and literature is organized regularly by the Dias family, to commemorate more than 175 years of Casa Da Moeda.</p>",

It was re-opened in 1961, in the last year of Portuguese rule in Goa.</p><p>In front of the chapel was the town pillory, which was a device similar to the 'stocks' for punishment and public humiliation of the erring. It was made of a wooden or metal framework erected on a post, with holes for securing the head and hands. The offender had to bend forward and stick his head and hands forward in a most uncomfortable manner. Sometimes a placard detailing the nature of the crime was placed next to it. People would gather around it to taunt, tease and laugh at the offender. </p>",

It is an important landmark that dominates the Fontainhas area. The right wing of the chapel houses a striking life-size crucifix, which once hung in the Palace of the Inquisition in Old Goa and was used in the processions, preceding the sitting of the Tribunal of the Inquisition. This statue is considered unusual as the image of Christ has its eyes wide open and was believed to be created, to instill fear in the minds of those being interrogated by the Inquisitors. It contains historic images and relics from other churches and convents around Goa, which, due to suppression of the religious orders from the Portuguese government, were demolished or shut down. The intricate woodwork on the alters are a study in craftsmanship. ",
